# Welcome to Travelatr!

Travelatr is company with a singular vision: to enable people from all walks of life to write about their travels to spectacular destinations all over the globe in order to foster a sense of global community and a heightened cultural awareness.

Our founder - a world renowned ice-cream-eating contest champion, gourmet hot-dog connoisseur, and bespoke phone case designer - has hired a diverse pool of talent to execute this vision, a pool that begins and ends with you!

## Instructions

Our vision has already begun! We've created migrations and a seed file for you to begin the execution of our vision! Create the associations within your models, then run `rake db:setup`!
